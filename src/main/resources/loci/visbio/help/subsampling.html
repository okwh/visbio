<html><body><h2>Subsamplings</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to create a version of your data at a lower
resolution, with fewer dimensional positions or fewer range components, to
conserve memory or improve rendering time. VisBio refers to this procedure as
"subsampling." To do it, first import your dataset as described in the
<a href="import_data.html">Importing a dataset from disk</a> topic. Select your
data from the list, then click the "Add &gt;" button and choose "Subsampling"
from the popup menu.

<p>Choose a name for the subsampling, and VisBio will create another data
object, a child of your original dataset, that represents the subsampling. To
alter the sampling parameters, select the subsampled data object and click the
"Edit" button. A window similar to this one will appear:

<p><img src="subsampling.png" alt="Subsampling parameters">

<p>You can subsample the image resolution, as well as each dimensional axis. In
the example above, Time is subsampled to every fourth timestep
(1, 5, 9, ..., 81, 85), and Slice is subsampled to every second timestep
(1, 3, 5, ..., 31, 33).

<p>Lastly, you can choose to exclude one or more range components of the data,
by unchecking those range component checkboxes. In the example above, there is
only one range component, and you must have at least one range component
included in the dataset (otherwise there would be no data!). However, if the
data instead had three components--Red, Green and Blue--you could
choose to include only the Green component, for example.

<p>When finished, click the "Apply" button to lock in your changes. VisBio will
recompute thumbnails as necessary for the new sampling parameters.
