<html><body><h2>Data transforms</h2>

<p>A data transform is a module that provides a method of generating data. The
most basic data transform is the <a href="dataset.html">Dataset</a>, which
retrieves data from files on disk, encapsulating them into a VisBio data
object which can then be visualized and analyzed.

<p>Most data transforms take a parent data object as input, and produce a child
data object as output. Such parent/child relationships are represented on the
<a href="data_panel.html">Data panel</a> using a tree structure. For example,
an annotated dataset might have a set of overlays represented as a child
<a href="overlays.html">Overlays</a> data object.

<p>VisBio provides a variety of built-in data transforms that produce data
objects from a data source or algorithm. For details about a specific
transform, choose a topic below.
