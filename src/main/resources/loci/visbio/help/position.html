<html><body><h2>Position settings</h2>

<p>Being able to quickly and easily switch between dimensional positions is
vital for proper data analysis. VisBio shows the current dimensional position
at the bottom of the display window's controls, with a series of sliders
available for roaming data quickly. Each slider corresponds to one of your
dataset's dimensional axes. Together, they specify the dimensional position of
the currently displayed image (or image stack).

<p>Directly above the sliders, the "Animate" button cycles through the selected
animation axis (specified in the drop-down box to the right of the button),
using low-resolution thumbnails. The "FPS" selector allows specification of
animation speed in frames per second.

<p>Above the animation controls, you can choose which axes are traversed when
the keyboard arrow keys are pressed. By default, left and right will roam
through time, while up and down will step across focal planes.
