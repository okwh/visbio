<html><body><h2>Display windows</h2>

<p>Each VisBio display appears in a separate window. Be default, the display
itself--a black area containing your image planes surrounded by a white
bounding box--is positioned on the left side of the window, while the controls
for manipulating the display are positioned on the right.

<br><h3>The breakaway control panel</h3>

Around the area with the controls are four arrow buttons. Clicking one of these
arrows moves the controls to that edge of the display window. For example,
clicking the left arrow positions the controls along the left edge of the
display window, with the display itself occupying the right-hand portion of the
window.

<p>Also, clicking the arrow corresponding to the edge where the controls are
already positioned causes them to "break away" from the display window and
float in their own separate window. To reattach the display controls, just
click one of the arrow buttons again. If you close a display window, or the
window containing the floating display controls, you can make it reappear by
clicking the "Show" button on VisBio's main
<a href="displays_panel.html">Displays panel</a>.

<br><h3>Control panel areas</h3>

The control panel is divided into three sections:

<ul>
  <li><a href="appearance.html">Appearance settings</a> control the parameters
    of the display itself. These controls--such as zoom, panning and
    rotation--affect the entire display.</li>
  <li><a href="data_settings.html">Data settings</a> control visual parameters
    of each linked data object. These controls--such as data visibility, color
    settings and rendering order--generally affect the appearance of the
    selected data object, rather than the entire display globally.</li>
  <li><a href="position.html">Position settings</a> affect the dimensional
    position of the data objects. Dimensional sliders for the display axes of
    all linked data objects are provided, with compatible axes represented by a
    single slider (e.g., two data objects' "Time" axes ranging from 1 to 12
    each are controlled with a single slider).</li>
</ul>

A vertical slider denotes each section of controls. For more information about
a section, see its help topic.
