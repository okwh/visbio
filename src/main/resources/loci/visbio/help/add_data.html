<html><body><h2>Adding a data object</h2>

<p>To create a data object, click the "Add &gt;" button on the
<a href="data_panel.html">Data panel</a>. A popup menu will appear allowing you
to select which data transform to use. 

<p>Most <a href="data_transforms.html">data transforms</a> require a parent
data object from which to derive their data. (The exceptions are
<a href="dataset.html">datasets</a> and
<a href="ome_image.html">OME images</a>, which are standalone.) If a parent
transform is needed, the currently selected data object will be used. If the
selected object is not a valid parent for a data transform for some reason, or
if no data object is selected, that transform will be grayed out.

<p>After you choose a name for the new data object, the default settings for
that transform will be used to compute the object. However, most transforms
have parameters you can adjust by clicking the "Edit" button after the data
object has been created.

<p>For more details about the specific data transforms available and their
parameters, see the <a href="data_transforms.html">Data transforms</a> topic.
