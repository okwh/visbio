<html><body><h2>Capture window</h2>

<p>The Capture window contains functions for recording movies of smooth
transitions between display positions, as well as taking display snapshots. To
access it, click the "Capture" button within the
<a href="appearance.html">Appearance</a> controls of a
<a href="display_windows.html">display window</a>, or the one on the
<a href="displays_panel.html">Displays panel</a>.

<br><h3>Creating a list of display positions</h3>

To create a movie of a VisBio display in motion, navigate the display to
the desired orientation (see the
<a href="display_windows.html">Display windows</a> topic for more information),
then click the "Add" button. An entry will appear on the list of display
positions. Repeat this process for each display position in the chain.

<p>The "Remove" button will eliminate the currently selected entry in the list.
The "Up" and "Down" buttons will move the currently selected entry up or down
in the list, respectively.

<p>You can click an entry on the list to restore the display to that position.
Thus, in addition to movie creation, the list serves as a useful way to capture
effective visualization angles.

<br><h3>Taking a snapshot of a display</h3>

The "Snapshot" button takes a snapshot of the display, saving it to an image
file on disk in TIFF or JPEG format.

<p>The "Send to ImageJ" button, instead of saving the snapshot to disk, instead
launches ImageJ and opens the snapshot within ImageJ for further processing.

<br><h3>Creating a movie of transitions</h3>

By clicking the "Record &gt;" button, VisBio will construct a movie consisting
of the display being rotated, panned and zoomed between the positions defined
in the list. In this way, a movie can be made of the display shifting between
any set of orientations. If "AVI movie" is chosen, the movie will be saved as a
single AVI movie. If "Image sequence" is selected, each frame of the movie will
be saved as a separate single-image TIFF or JPEG file.

<p>By default, the transitions start slowly, speed up, then slow down again at
each display position, resulting in a smooth animation with emphasis on each of
the defined display positions. However, by unchecking the "Emphasize transition
at each display position" checkbox, this behavior can be changed so that each
transition is completely linear.

<p>Lastly, the speed of the transitions can be controlled with the "Seconds per
transition" slider, and "Frames per second" spinner. (Note that the frames per
second is only saved for AVI movies, not image sequences.)
