<html><body><h2>Exporting data directly to ImageJ</h2>

<p>VisBio can export data directly to ImageJ for further analysis. To export
the current data object, click the "Export &gt;" button on the
<a href="data.html">Data panel</a>, then choose "Send to ImageJ..." from the
popup menu. If the current data object contains at least one dimensional axis,
a dialog box titled "Send data to ImageJ" will appear:

<p><img src="export-imagej.png" alt="Send to ImageJ dialog">

<p>Choose the dimensional position of the image you wish to send to ImageJ.
You can send a stack of images all at once by choosing a stack axis from the
dropdown combo box.

<p>Click the "Ok" button and VisBio will begin exporting your data to ImageJ.
