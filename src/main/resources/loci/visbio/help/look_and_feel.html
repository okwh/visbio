<html><body><h2>Changing VisBio's appearance</h2>

<p>Although VisBio is written in Java, it is configured to appear as much like
native applications on your platform as possible. If you don't like the way
VisBio looks, you can change the graphical "Look &amp; Feel." Click the
"Change..." button next to the "Look &amp; Feel" value, and choose a new Look
&amp; Feel from the dropdown list.

<p>Depending on your platform, the following Look &amp; Feels may be available:

<ul>
  <li><b>Metal</b> - The standard Java Look &amp; Feel
    (all platforms)</li>
  <li><b>JGoodies Windows</b> - The standard Windows Look &amp; Feel
    (Windows only; Windows default)</li>
  <li><b>Mac OS X Aqua</b> - The standard Mac OS X Look &amp; Feel
    (Mac OS X only; Mac OS X default)</li>
  <li><b>CDE/Motif</b> - The standard X Windows Look &amp; Feel
    (all platforms)</li>
    </li>
  <li><b>JGoodies Plastic</b> - A nice Look &amp; Feel designed by
    <a href="http://jgoodies.com/about.html">Karsten Lentzsch</a>
    (all platforms)</li>
  <li><b>JGoodies Plastic 3D</b> - A 3D version of JGoodies Plastic
    (all platforms; Linux default)</li>
  <li><b>JGoodies Plastic XP</b> - A version of JGoodies Plastic
    that matches Windows XP (all platforms)</li>
</ul>

<p>This change requires the program to be restarted before taking effect.

<p>If you are using VisBio's
<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/web-start">online
distribution</a>, please note that the Look and Feel is set to JGoodies Plastic
3D and cannot be changed through the user interface.
