<html><body><h2>Displays panel</h2>

<p>VisBio allows you to create many displays simultaneously (up to 32), with
each one providing its own window into your data. The Displays panel provides
tools for managing these displays.

<p>The list on the left side of the panel shows the currently available
displays.

<p>To create a new 2D display, click the "Add 2D..." button. To create a new 3D
display, click the "Add 3D..." button.

<p>To show a display window onscreen, select the desired display from the list
and click the "Show" button. Note that the "Show" button is only available if
the display contains at least one linked data object. See the
<a href="display_windows.html">Display windows</a> topic for an overview of
display windows and how to use them.

<p>VisBio allows recording of movies and capturing of screenshots for any
display. To access controls for performing these tasks for a given display,
select it and click the "Capture" button. A dialog box will appear for creating
screenshots and movies. See the
<a href="capture_window.html">Capture window</a> topic for complete
instructions on using this dialog box.

<p>Lastly, to remove a display from the list, select it and click the "Remove"
button.
