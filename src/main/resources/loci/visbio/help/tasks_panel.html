<html><body><h2>Tasks panel</h2>

<p>The Tasks panel displays a list of operations that VisBio is currently
performing, such as data import, data export, and thumbnail generation. Each
task is represented by a slider showing current progress and a brief
description of which step of the task is currently happening.

<p>The "Stop" button on the right instructs VisBio to cancel the operation
prematurely, abandoning it. For example, if you do not care whether VisBio
pregenerates thumbnails for your data, you could stop thumbnail generation in
this fashion. Please note that some tasks cannot be canceled.
