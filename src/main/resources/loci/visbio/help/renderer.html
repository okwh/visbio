<html><body><h2>Changing the renderer</h2>

<p>VisBio uses Java3D to visualize data in two and three dimensions. On most
platforms, Java3D uses OpenGL to render the data, but on Windows you have the
option of either OpenGL (the cross-platform solution) or Direct3D (the
Microsoft solution). If you experience program crashes or blank displays with
one of the renderers, you might have better luck with the other one. To switch,
click the "Change..." button next to the "Renderer" value, and choose the
desired renderer from the dropdown list.

<p>This change requires the program to be restarted before taking effect.

<p>If you are using VisBio's
<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/web-start">online
distribution</a>, please note that the renderer is set to OpenGL
and cannot be changed through the user interface.
