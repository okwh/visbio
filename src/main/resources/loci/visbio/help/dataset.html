<html><body><h2>Datasets</h2>

<p>The dataset is the basic data transform upon which the others operate. Most
other transforms require a parent transform as input, from which to compute
their output data. For example, a <a href="subsampling.html">Subsampling</a>
transform takes an input data object and reduces the image resolution or the
number of total image planes.

<p>A dataset does not have an input data transform. Instead, it gets its input
from source files on disk in one of the
<a href="formats.html">supported file formats</a>. For instructions on how to
create a dataset from files on disk, see the
<a href="import_data.html">Importing a dataset from disk</a> topic.
