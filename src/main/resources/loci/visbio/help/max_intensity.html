<html><body><h2>Maximum intensity projections</h2>

<p>The maximum intensity projection transform allows you to select a
dimensional axis and computes the maximum intensity projection across all image
planes along that axis. To do it, first import your dataset as described in the
<a href="import_data.html">Importing a dataset from disk</a> topic. Select your
data from the list, then click the "Add &gt;" button and choose "Maximum
intensity projection" from the popup menu.

<p>Choose a name for the maximum intensity projection, and VisBio will create
another data object, a child of your original dataset, that represents the
projected data. To alter which dimension is projected, select the projected
data object and click the "Edit" button. A window similar to this one will
appear:

<p><img src="max-intensity.png" alt="Maximum intensity projection parameters">

<p>After choosing a dimensional axis to project from the pulldown menu, click
the "Apply" button to lock in your changes. VisBio will recompute thumbnails as
necessary for the new projection parameters.

<p>For example, say you have imported a 4D dataset with 85 time points and 33
focal planes of color images (three range components: Red, Green and Blue). If
you project the slice dimension, the resultant data object will have 85 time
points, with 3 range components, with each image plane containing the maximum
intensity of each pixel across all focal planes at that time point.
