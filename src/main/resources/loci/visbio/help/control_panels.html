<html><body><h2>Control panels</h2>

<p>VisBio's core features are divided into control panels:

<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="data_panel.html">Data panel</a> contains the tools necessary
    for importing and exporting datasets, and managing derivative data objects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="displays_panel.html">Displays panel</a> lists all the
    displays that have been created, with controls for managing them.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="tasks_panel.html">Tasks panel</a> shows the operations that
    VisBio is currently performing, with the ability to halt tasks if desired.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="system_panel.html">System panel</a> shows technical
    information about your computer system, with controls to adjust VisBio's
    memory usage and appearance.
  </li>
</ul>

When you first run VisBio, the Data, Displays and Tasks panels are visible in
the main window. The System panel can be accessed by choosing "System
information" from the "Window" menu.
