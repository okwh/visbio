    for importing and exporting datasets, and managing derivative data objects.
  </li>

    The <a href="displays_panel.html">Displays panel</a> lists all the
    displays that have been created, with controls for managing them.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="tasks_panel.html">Tasks panel</a> shows the operations that
    VisBio is currently performing, with the ability to halt tasks if desired.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="system_panel.html">System panel</a> shows technical
    information about your computer system, with controls to adjust VisBio's
    memory usage and appearance.

</ul>

When you first run VisBio, the Data, Displays and Tasks panels are visible in
the main window. The System panel can be accessed by choosing "System
