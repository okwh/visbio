/**
 * The Dynamic interface provides methods for testing whether two objects have
 * the same state, and for synchronizing states if they do not. The reason for
 * such an interface is to assist with state salvation and restoration (see the
 * Saveable interface). When we read a new list of Dynamic objects from a state
 * file, we need a way to determine how closely the list in memory matches the
 * one just read, as well as an efficient way to modify the existing list to
 * conform to the one just read without necessarily recreating all those objects
 * from scratch (which could be quite expensive). Thus, these "dynamic" objects
 * implement the matches method to test if a freshly read dynamic object is in
 * the same state as any of the current objects. If so, there is no need to
 * reinitialize that object&mdash;we can just use the existing one. If not, we
 * call the initState method to force the original object's state to conform to
 * the one just read, without needing to recreate the object itself or relink it
 * into data structures. The {@link loci.visbio.state.StateManager} class
 * contains the mergeStates static method, which performs this procedure on two
 * lists of dynamic objects.
