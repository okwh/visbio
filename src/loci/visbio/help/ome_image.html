<html><body><h2>OME images</h2>

<p>An OME image is a basic data transform that derives its data from an image
in an <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/">Open Microscopy Environment</a>
(OME) database. When creating an OME image data object, you will be asked to
provide login information for an OME server, as well as the ID number of the
image you wish to download.

<p><i>[Author's note: Requiring you to know the image ID is somewhat crude,
although efficient. Future versions of VisBio will provide more sophisticated
techniques for choosing OME images for download, including searching and
browsing of the OME database.]</i>
