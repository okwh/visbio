<html><body><h2>Changing the memory limit</h2>

<p>You can change the maximum amount of memory allocated to VisBio. Click the
"Change..." button next to the "Memory maximum" value, and type a new value (in
megabytes) into the dialog box that appears. This change requires the program
to be restarted before taking effect. The new value must be at least 16, and
should be 512 or greater to take advantage of many of VisBio's features. For
high-resolution volume rendering at least 1280 is suggested. It is also
recommended that you do not specify a value greater than the amount of physical
RAM your computer has. Lastly, because 32-bit Java has a hard limit of 2048,
specifying a value greater than 1800 or so may not work on many systems.

<p>If you change the maximum memory value and VisBio then fails to load, then
you have probably entered a value that is too large for your computer to
handle. Reinstalling VisBio will fix the problem. Alternately, if you know what
you are doing, you can change it back manually by altering the "-mx###m" value
within the proper configuration file ("launcher.cfg" on Windows, "VisBio.app/Contents/Info.plist" on Mac OS X, or "visbio" on Linux).

<p>If you are using VisBio's
<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/download_jws.html">online
distribution</a>, please note that the memory limit is fixed at 512 MB and
cannot be changed through the user interface.
