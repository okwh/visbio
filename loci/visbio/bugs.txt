Bugfixes and enhancements:

  - "Add" button in display dialog should gray out data transforms that are
    already being displayed.

  - "Displays" button should only show displays that can properly display the
    data. So, if the data transform is 3D only, only 3D displays should be
    shown, etc.

  - Data transforms must have a "destroy" method that is called when they are
    deleted, so that (e.g.) their GUI controls do not remain in memory.

  - Data transforms have an event they generate when their parameters change.
    Children transforms must listen to this event and react to it.
    Also update HTML description panel when data transform's parameters change.

  - Flag indicating whether latest state change should "stack up" or "replace"
    last change (if last change was of the same type as this one)

  - Ensure all modal dialogs are standalone or based on an appropriate parent
    (i.e., not VisBioFrame)

  - Change color dialog to include more alpha tools.
  - Add transparency controls to left side of color dialog box.

  - Change each data object to have its own MathType for better color controls.

  - Make Up and Down buttons in display window's controls actually work.

  - Command+? Macintosh Help shortcut does not function.

  - Set "Window Modified Indicator" when content has changed since last save?

  - Use java.awt.FileDialog on Mac OS X?
