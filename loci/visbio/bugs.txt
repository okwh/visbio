This file lists bugfixes and enhancements to address.
Priority is ranked H (high), N (normal) or L (low).


Data engine
-----------

[M] Data transforms have an event they generate when their parameters change.
    Children transforms must listen to this event and react to it.
    Also update HTML description panel when data transform's parameters change.

[M] Add hooks to the data transform model to allow alternative thumbnail
    computation implementation on a per-transform basis, rather than always
    doing a full-resolution computation followed by a resampling to low res.

[L] Expand DataCache functionality to allow multiple dimensional positions in
    memory at once. This allows crisper, faster animation at full resolution.

[L] Some derivative transforms are designed to be shown only in the same window
    as their parent transform (overlays, arbitrary slices). These transforms
    should return true for a new "isShownWithParent" method, and if they are
    added to a display that does not already contain their parent transform,
    the parent is automatically added first.


File formats
------------

[L] VisAD QT reader is horribly inefficient for multi-file datasets; clean up
    code to acceptable standards.

[L] Fix bug in many file readers where ImageLine is numbered upside down so
    that VisAD displays the image right side up. The numbering should be
    normal, not an upside down Linear2DSet, and then the range should be set
    in the display so that the image is displayed properly anyway. This way,
    using the VisAD cursor actually returns the proper results.

    If this breaks VisAD too much (probably would), then just have VisBio flip
    the domain sets of all images that get read in, so that the cursor is
    correct.

[L] Ignore Openlab images named "Original Image."


State engine
------------

[H] Redo multiple undo/redo support to save an inverse command that undoes the
    action that was just done, instead of loading state files. This is required
    because loading state files is simply too slow. For example, if there are
    30 MB worth of overlays, loading them all back in every time the user wants
    to undo a simple overlay alteration is prohibitively expensive.

[H] Fix improper restoration of 3D displays.

[H] Fix improper restoration of display color settings.

[H] Fix improper restoration of display positions on Capture panel.

[M] Save and restore breakaway control panel properly.

[L] Flag indicating whether latest state change should "stack up" or "replace"
    last change (if last change was of the same type as this one).

[L] When state file path is the same folder or an ancestor folder of a dataset
    path, use relative paths to describe that dataset in the XML, to improve
    portability of state files between machines.

[L] Set "Window Modified Indicator" when content has changed since last state
    save?


Overlays transform
------------------

[H] Overlays need to be fixed to display properly in 3D displays.

[H] Overlays should not affect ScalarMap scaling.

[L] Add rubber band box renderer to all displays (at least 2D ones) and send
    "rubber band" events down the transform chain so that transforms can react
    (in particular, so OverlayTransform can do multiple selection).

[L] Loading a large number of overlays causes a hiccup; at the least, put up an
    hourglass while this is happening.

User interface
--------------

[M] Make sure no two data objects can have the same name. If one already does,
    append "2", "3", etc., to the end until we find a new name. If they try to
    create one with the same name as an existing one, don't let them do it.

    Probably also don't let them create two displays with the same name
    (use same strategy), because otherwise state might not restore correctly.

[L] Eliminate obsolete control panel logic in favor of one master VisBio window
    with data, displays and tasks information.

[L] Command+? Macintosh Help shortcut does not function.

[L] Use java.awt.FileDialog on Mac OS X?

[L] Add -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true to options, and add option to toggle it
    (Java 1.5+ only)


Open Microscopy Environment
---------------------------

[L] Create a command-line upload utility for use doing generic client-side
    uploads--use loci.visbio.ome.ImageUploader.main(String[]) for this.

[L] Upload to OME works, but produces a bunch of annoying messages on the
    error stream anyway.

Java Web Start
--------------

[L] Friendlier JAR signing technique for Java Web Start distribution.
