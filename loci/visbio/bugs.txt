Bugfixes and enhancements:

  - "Add" button in display dialog should gray out data transforms that are already being displayed.

  - "Displays" button should only show displays that can properly display the data. So, if the data
    transform is 3D only, only 3D displays should be shown, etc.

  - Change mappings to Display.RGBA and add transparency controls to left side of color dialog box.

  - Data transforms must have a "destroy" method that is called when they are
    deleted, so that (e.g.) their GUI controls do not remain in memory.

  - Data transforms have an event they generate when their parameters change.
    Children transforms must listen to this event and react to it.
    Also update HTML description panel when data transform's parameters change.

  - Flag indicating whether latest state change should "stack up" or "replace" last change
    (if last change was of the same type as this one)

  - Ensure all nonmodal dialogs are standalone

  - Ensure all modal dialogs are standalone or based on an appropriate parent (i.e., not VisBioFrame)

  - Fix Mac OS X menu bar problem with menu bar hacks for OS X

  - Ensure new WindowManager fixes VisBio windowing issues on Mac OS X

  - Change color dialog to include alpha component, for maximum power
