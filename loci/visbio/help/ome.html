<h2>Uploading to OME</h2>
</center>
<p>
To upload data to an OME
(<a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/">Open Microscopy Environment</a>)
database, select the data to be uploaded from the <a href="data.html">Data</a>
panel, click the "Export" button, then choose "Upload to OME" from the menu.
<p>
A dialog box titled "Upload to OME" will appear. Specify the address of the
OME server (e.g., "cyber.microscopy.wisc.edu"), as well as the username and
password of the login to use for upload.
<p>
Click the "Ok" button, and the Data status bar will report the status of the
upload process as it progresses. If there are any problems during upload, they
will be reported in VisBio's "Error console" window, which will appear
automatically.
