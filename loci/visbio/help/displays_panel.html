<html><body><h2>Displays panel</h2>

<p>VisBio allows you to create many displays simultaneously (up to 32), with
each one providing its own window into your data. The Displays panel provides
tools for managing these displays.

<p>The list on the left side of the panel shows the currently available
displays.

<p>To create a new 2D display, click the "Add 2D" button. To create a new 3D
display, click the "Add 3D" button.

<p>To show a display window onscreen, select the desired display from the list
and click the "Show" button. See the
<a href="display_windows.html">Display windows</a> topic for an overview of
display windows and how to use them.

<p>VisBio allows recording of movies and capturing of screenshots for any
display. To access controls for performing these tasks for a given display,
select it and click the "Capture" button. A dialog box will appear for creating
screenshots and movies. See the
<a href="capture_window.html">Capture window</a> topic for complete
instructions on using this dialog box.

<p>Lastly, to remove a display from the list, select it and click the "Remove"
button.
