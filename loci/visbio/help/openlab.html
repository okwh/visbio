<html><body><h2>Openlab LIFF</h2>

<p>VisBio supports reading and writing Openlab LIFF files (not including
metadata), but it requires that QuickTime for Java be installed.

<p>If you are running Mac OS X, you probably already have QuickTime installed.
If you are running Linux, QuickTime is unfortunately not available. If you do
not have QuickTime installed, visit the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone/">QuickTime download page</a>.
Once QuickTime for Java is installed on your machine, VisBio will be able to
import Openlab LIFF files.
