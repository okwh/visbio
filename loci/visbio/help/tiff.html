<html><body><h2>TIFF stacks</h2>

<p>VisBio supports reading uncompressed and LZW-compressed TIFF stacks (not
including metadata). Support is completely native, with no additional libraries
required.

<p>VisBio also supports writing TIFF stacks using ImageJ (which comes packaged
with VisBio). In addition, VisBio can take advantage of the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/">Java Advanced
Imaging</a> package should it be installed, enabling support for a wider
variety of TIFF features.
