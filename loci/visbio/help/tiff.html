<html><body><h2>TIFF stacks</h2>

<p>VisBio supports reading uncompressed and LZW-compressed TIFF stacks,
including metadata. Support is completely native, with no additional libraries
required.

<p>For certain kinds of TIFF, VisBio utilizes the
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a> library (packaged with
VisBio). In addition, VisBio can take advantage of the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/">Java Advanced
Imaging</a> package should it be installed, enabling support for reading a
wider variety of TIFF features.

<p>VisBio also supports writing uncompressed and LZW-compressed TIFF stacks
natively plane by plane, to minimize memory usage.
