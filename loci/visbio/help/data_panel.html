<html><body><h2>Data panel</h2>

<p>The Data panel allows you to import data into VisBio, so that you can begin
visualization and analysis. It also allows you to construct and manage
derivative data objects (data computed from your source datasets). Lastly, it
displays technical details about data objects, and provides export
capabilities, including saving to disk and uploading to an OME database.

<p>The tree in the upper left portion of the panel shows all data objects
currently available. Derivative data objects are shown as children of the data
from which they were derived.

<p>The lower portion of the panel shows a summary of the data object, including
a list of its dimensional axes, pixel resolution and total size.

<p>The upper right portion of the panel contains several buttons. The "Add
&gt;" button creates a new data object (derived from files on disk, an OME
database, or another data object). See the
<a href="import_data.html">Importing a dataset from disk</a> and
<a href="add_data.html">Adding a data object</a> topics for more information.

<p>The "Display &gt;" button visualizes the selected data object. See the
<a href="display_data.html">Displaying a data object</a> topic for more
information.

<p>The "Edit" button shows controls for manipulating the parameters of the
selected data object. For datasets, it displays metadata associated within each
file on disk. The button is grayed out when no controls or information are
available.

<p>The "Export &gt;" button saves the selected data object to files on disk, or
uploads them to an OME database. See the
<a href="export_data.html">Exporting data to disk</a> and
<a href="upload_ome.html">Uploading to an OME database</a> topics for more
information.

<p>The "Remove" button deletes the selected data object. (If the data object
was created from files on disk or downloaded from an OME database, it does not
delete the files or database entry, only VisBio's internal representation.)
