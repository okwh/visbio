<html><body><h2>Data panel</h2>

<p>The Data panel allows you to import data into VisBio, so that you can begin
visualization and analysis. Importing your data is usually the first step when
using VisBio. It also displays technical details about data objects, and
provides export capabilities, saving to disk or uploading to an OME database.

<p>For an introduction to multidimensional data, please read the
<a href="introduction.html">Introduction</a> first.

<br><h3>Other data functions</h3>

Lastly, you may have noticed two other buttons relating to data objects. The
"Export" button lets you export the data object to a group of files on disk
(see <a href="export.html">Exporting data to disk</a>) or upload it to an OME
database (see <a href="upload_ome.html">Uploading to an OME database</a>). The
"Remove" button deletes the selected data object. Note that if the data object
to be removed has children, they will be deleted as well.

<p><i>[Author's note: Sorry, "Export to disk" feature is not available in this
beta release.]</i>
