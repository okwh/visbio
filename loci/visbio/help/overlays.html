<html><body><h2>Overlays</h2>

<p>The overlays transform provides a means for creating graphical
overlays--such as lines, ovals, boxes and text--atop another data object. 
Overlay annotations are useful for many reasons: dividing a complex image into
scientifically relevant sections, measuring numerical characteristics, and
demonstrating biological phenomena for instructional purposes, for example.

<br><h3>Creating a set of overlays</h3>

To create a set of overlays, first import your dataset as described in the
<a href="import_data.html">Importing a dataset from disk</a> topic. Select your
dataset from the list, then click the "Add &gt;" button and choose "Overlays"
from the popup menu.

<p>Choose a name for the overlays, and VisBio will create another data
object, a child of your original dataset, that represents the overlays. To
access the tools for drawing overlays, select the overlays and click the "Edit"
button. A window similar to this one will appear:

<p><img src="overlays.png" alt="Parameters for overlays">

<p>To begin drawing overlays, you must first display them in 2D atop the parent
dataset. First, add your dataset to a 2D display as described in the
<a href="display_data.html">Displaying a data object</a> topic. Then add the
overlays to the same 2D display (not a new one). Doing so will overlay them
atop your image.

<p><i>[Author's note: On some systems, the rendering order of the dataset and
the overlays may need to be reversed. If you see nothing when drawing overlays,
select the overlays from the display window's list of linked data objects and
click the "Up" button to move them up in the rendering order.</i>

<br><h3>Drawing new overlays</h3>

To draw an overlay, choose the appropriate tool from the "Tools" section of the
overlay controls. The tools shown above (from left to right) are: pointer,
line, marker, text, oval, box and arrow. In many ways, they behave like
similar tools available in many image editing programs.

<ul>
  <li>The <b>pointer tool</b> is for selecting existing overlays. Click an
    overlay to select it. Use Shift+click to add the clicked overlay to the
    selection. Use Ctrl+click to add or remove the clicked overlay to or from
    the selection. Selected overlays have a yellow mesh grid surrounding them.
    Information about the selected overlays is shown in the "Statistics" area
    at the bottom of the overlay controls.</li>
  <li>The <b>line tool</b> draws lines from one point to another. Click and
    drag across the display to draw a new line.</li>
  <li>The <b>marker tool</b> draws markers at a given point. Click a point in
    the display to place a crosshairs there.</li>
  <li>The <b>text tool</b> draws text at a given point. Click a point in the
    display to place a new text object there, then type letters for them to
    appear at that location.</li>
  <li>The <b>oval tool</b> draws an ellipse. Click and drag across the display
    to draw a new ellipse whose diagonal matches the path you draw.</li>
  <li>The <b>box tool</b> draws a rectangle. Click and drag across the display
    to draw a new rectangle whose diagonal matches the path you draw.</li>
  <li>The <b>arrow tool</b> draws an arrow. Click and drag across the display
    to draw a new arrow which stretches across the path you draw, with the
    arrow's tip corresponding to the point at which you press the mouse
    button.</li>
</ul>

To use a tool, click the associated tool button.

<br><h3>Altering existing overlays</h3>

You can use the overlays controls to alter the characteristics of selected
overlays. First use the pointer tool to select the overlays you wish to change,
or select them from the overlay list on the left side of the "Overlays" section
of controls. Note that the overlay list only shows overlays for the current
dimensional position.

<p>To remove an overlay, press click the "Remove" button or press the Delete
key.

<p>To change an overlay's position, type in new values for the (X1, Y1) or
(X2, Y2) coordinate values.

<p>To change the text shown for a Text overlay, type new text into the "Text"
box.

<p>To change the color of the selected overlays, click the button labeled
"Color" to bring up a dialog box for choosing a new color.

<p>Some overlays--ovals, boxes and arrows--can be filled in (solid) or
hollow. To toggle which for the selected overlays, use the "Filled" checkbox.

<p>Each overlay allows you to store one line of miscellaneous notes. To make a
note for the selected overlays, type your note into the "Notes" text box.

<br><h3>Grouping overlays</h3>

Each overlay has an associated group. This feature is useful if one collection
of overlays tracks a particular phenomenon, while another collection of
overlays tracks another phenomenon. In this case, each collection can be
assigned to a different group to differentiate between the collections.

<p>To choose the group to which the selected overlays belong, choose a group
from the "Group" dropdown box. New groups can be created by clicking the
"New..." button next to the "Group" box.

<br><h3>Changing the font</h3>

Each set of overlays uses a particular font to display text overlays. The font
being used is shown in the "Font" text box. To change it, click the nearby
"Change..." button. A dialog box will pop up allowing you to select a new font.
Please note that this setting affects all text overlays in the set, not just
the selected ones.

<br><h3>Saving your work</h3>

You can save your overlays to a tab-delineated text file on disk (readable by
spreadsheet applications for further analysis). Click the "Save overlays..."
button to do so.

<p>You can restore saved overlays by using the "Load overlays..." button and
choosing a text file saved earlier. Please note that loading an overlay set
will clear out any current overlays, overwriting them with those saved in the
text file.
