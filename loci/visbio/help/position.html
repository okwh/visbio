<p>The "Animate" button cycles through the selected animation axis (specified
in the drop-down box to the right of the button), using low-resolution
thumbnails. The "FPS" selector allows specification of animation speed in
frames per second.

<p>Below the animation controls are a series of sliders corresponding to your
data's dimensional axes. These sliders control the currently displayed image
(or image stack). Use them judiciously to browse your data's depths!
