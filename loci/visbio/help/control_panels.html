<html><body><h2>Control panels</h2>

<p>VisBio's core features are divided into control panels:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="data_panel.html">Data panel</a> - contains the tools necessary
    for importing and exporting datasets, and managing derivative data objects
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="displays_panel.html">Displays panel</a> - lists all the
    displays that have been created, with controls for managing them
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="system_panel.html">System panel</a> - shows technical
    information about your computer system, with controls to adjust VisBio's
    memory usage and appearance
  </li>
</ul>

When you first run VisBio, these panels are visible as tabs in the main
window. Alternatively, you can set each control panel to float in its own
window frame by checking "Floating control windows" in the VisBio options
("Options..." from the "File" menu). When in this mode, VisBio instead shows a
button for each control panel, which brings up that panel in its own window
when clicked.
