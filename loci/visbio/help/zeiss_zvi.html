<html><body><h2>Zeiss ZVI (Axiovision)</h2>

<p>VisBio supports reading some types of Zeiss Axiovision (ZVI) files (not
including metadata). Support is completely native, with no additional libraries
required.

<p>ZVI support was added through trial and error (i.e., reverse engineering
several example ZVI files), and does not work with some types of ZVI. It has
been tested to work with 8-bit image stacks, 16-bit single images and 24-bit
color images, and should work with 16-bit stacks and 24-bit color stacks as
well.
