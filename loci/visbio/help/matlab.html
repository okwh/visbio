<html><body><h2>MATLAB functions</h2>

<p>VisBio has the ability to interface with MATLAB. If you have a routine
written in MATLAB, you can set up a MATLAB function data object that takes an
existing data object as input and generates output data by calling its
associated MATLAB function for each image plane.

<br><h3>Configuring MATLAB for use with VisBio</h3>

To connect to MATLAB, VisBio must be launched from within the MATLAB
environment. To make this possible, follow these steps:

<ol>
  <li>Start MATLAB.</li>

  <li>At the prompt, type:
  <blockquote><code>
  edit classpath.txt
  </code></blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>Scroll to the bottom of the file, and append one line for each of
  VisBio's JAR files. These files can be found in your VisBio folder (on Mac OS
  X, option-click the VisBio icon and choose "Show package contents" from the
  menu, then navigate into Contents, Resources, Java to find the JAR files). On
  each line, put the full path of one JAR file. For example, if you are running
  Windows and installed VisBio to "<code>C:\Program Files\VisBio</code>" you
  would add the following lines:
  <blockquote><code>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\commons-httpclient-2.0-rc2.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\commons-logging.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\forms-1.0.4.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\ij.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\loci-ome-xml.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\looks-1.2.2.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\ome-java.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\visad.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\visbio.jar<br>
    C:\Program Files\VisBio\xmlrpc-1.2-b1.jar
  </code></blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>Save the file and close the editor.</li>

  <li>Restart MATLAB to apply the classpath changes.</li>
</ol>

The above steps need only be performed once.

<br><h3>Launching VisBio from within MATLAB</h3>

Once you have configured the classpath as described above, change the MATLAB
working directory to your VisBio folder, then type "<code>visbio</code>" to
launch VisBio. For example, if you are running Windows and installed VisBio to
"<code>C:\Program Files\VisBio</code>" you could type the following at the
MATLAB prompt:
<blockquote><code>
  cd 'C:\Program Files\VisBio'<br>
  visbio
</code></blockquote>

<p>After VisBio starts up, check the
<a href="system_panel.html">System panel</a>. The MATLAB library should show
a version number (if it says "Missing" then something went wrong). You should
also see "MATLAB function" listed as an option beneath the "Add &gt;" button
on the <a href="data_panel.html">Data panel</a>.

<br><h3>Calling a MATLAB function from VisBio</h3>

First, import your dataset as described in the
<a href="import_data.html">Importing a dataset from disk</a> topic. Select your
data from the list, then click the "Add &gt;" button and choose "MATLAB
function" from the popup menu.

<p>Type in your function's name, then choose a name for the MATLAB object.
VisBio will create another data object, a child of your original dataset, that
represents the results of the function. VisBio will call your MATLAB function
for each image plane of the parent data object.

<br><h3>Writing a MATLAB function for use in VisBio</h3>

VisBio expects MATLAB functions to be declared in a specific way. Your
function's declaration should be as follows:
<blockquote><code>
  function [result] = fname(pix, params)
</code></blockquote>
where "<code>fname</code>" is the name of your function, "<code>pix</code>" is
a 3D array of pixels dimensioned (Y, X, N), and "<code>params</code>" is a
vector of any additional numeric parameters needed for your algorithm.

<p>VisBio calls the function in three distinct ways. First, it calls
<code>fname([], [])</code> to retrieve a list of parameters and their default
values. It expects to get back a cell array of 1x2 cell arrays, with the first
element containing a string indicating the parameter's name, and the second
element containing a double-precision floating point value indicating its
default value. See the convert.m example script for an illustration.

<p>Secondly, VisBio will call <code>fname([], [Y X N A B C ...])</code>, where
Y, X and N represent the dimensions of an input image (X by Y resolution with N
range components) and A, B, C, etc., are parameter values for the function.
VisBio expects to get back a vector of length 3 containing the Y, X and N
dimension of the output image that would be produced were an actual image to be
passed in with the specified parameters. The purpose of requiring this
functionality is to provide VisBio with a way to predict how big the output
images will be for a given set of input images with certain parameter values.
Note that VisBio requires that all output images be dimensioned the same for
each given set of image dimensions and parameters.

<p>Lastly, VisBio make the actual call of <code>fname(pix, params)</code> to
obtain the result for a given image plane with the specified parameters.

<p>VisBio comes with several example functions (files with extension .m, other
than visbio.m and vbget.m), which should serve to illustrate the proper
structure. It is probably easiest to begin with one of them, edit as desired,
and save to a new file.
