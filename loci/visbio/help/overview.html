<h2>VisBio Overview</h2>
</center>
<p>
Welcome to VisBio, a tool for visualization and analysis of multidimensional
image data. Recommended by four out of five biologists over a backpack full of
angry weasels.
<p>
Before you dig into VisBio's visualization and analysis features, you'll want
a basic understanding of what constitutes multidimensional image data, how
VisBio handles it, and how to get your data imported into the program.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Multidimensional image data basics</b></font>
<p>
In essence, multidimensional image data is simply a collection of images,
arranged in some fashion. For example, a typical 3D biological dataset might
consist of an animation of images across time (the three dimensions are image
width, image height, and time). Now, if instead there are images from several
microscope focal planes at each time point, the dataset is often called 4D
(image width, image height, time and focal plane form the four dimensions).
<p>
VisBio generalizes these concepts, allowing you to import a group of images
with any number of additional dimensional axes, such as time, focal planes,
spectra and lifetime bins. As long as your images are organized across such
axes in some fashion, VisBio can import the data.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Importing multidimensional image data</b></font>
<p>
The next few sections will explain how to import your multidimensional image
data into VisBio effectively.
<p>
Throughout this explanation, we'll be using an example dataset called "dub,"
courtesy of Dr. Bill Mohler. The dataset consists of 85 Bio-Rad PIC files,
numbered dub01.pic through dub85.pic. The data is a time series of image
stacks, with each file representing one timestep, and each timestep containing
33 images (sampled at 33 distinct focal planes). Each image is 768 x 512
pixels, and the dataset is about 1 GB total on disk. Note that the "sdub"
dataset available for download from the
<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/">VisBio website</a> is a downsampled
version of the full "dub" dataset.
<p>
From VisBio's perspective, this data is a collection of images with two unique
dimensional axes: Time and Slice. To most effectively work with this data, it
is important that you properly specify these dimensions during data import.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Defining a raw dataset</b></font>
<p>
To import your data into VisBio, choose the "Import data..." item from the
"File" menu (or click the "Add &gt;" button on the <a href="data.html">Data</a>
panel, then choose "Dataset" from the popup menu).
<p>
A dialog box titled "Open file group" will appear. Click "Select file" and a
file chooser dialog box will appear. Now, navigate to the proper folder, select
one of the files in your dataset, and click "Open." VisBio will determine the
appropriate file pattern for your dataset. For example:
<br>
<center><img src="import-dialog1.png"></center>
<p>
In the above example, the pattern indicates that all files numbered dub01.pic,
dub02.pic, dub03.pic, etc., through dub85.pic, will be included in the dataset.
<p>
Click the "Next" button to continue. You will now see a dialog box that looks
like:
<br>
<center><img src="import-dialog2.png"></center>
<p>
The top line (in this case, "C:\java\data\biorad\billm\dub&lt;01-85&gt;.pic")
contains the file pattern from the previous screen. Each dimensional range tag
(e.g., "&lt;01-85&gt;") represents one of the dataset's dimensional axes.
In this case, VisBio guesses that the file numbering marked "&lt;01-85&gt;" is
a Time dimension. Of course, you can use the dropdown list box to change the
dimension to Slice or some other dimension, if your data is organized that way.
You can even type in a custom name for the dimensional axis if you wish.
<p>
Also, within each file, there are often several images. In the above case, the
data contains 33 images per file. VisBio has guessed that the image data within
each file is Slice data, but again, you can change that to Time or some other
dimension.
<p>
After tweaking any necessary settings, click "Finish." The dataset has now been
imported, and the data information box will contain a bunch of information. In
our example, it will look like:
<br>
<center><table border="1"><tr><td>
C:\java\data\biorad\billm\dub<01-85>.pic
<p>
Dimensionality: 4D
<ul>
  <li>85 time points</li>
  <li>33 focal planes</li>
  <li>768 x 512 pixels</li>
  <li>1 range component</li>
</ul>
85 Bio-Rad PIC files in dataset.
<br>2805 images totaling 1.03 gigapixels.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
Now VisBio understands how your data is organized. For more information about
managing data objects, see the <a href="data.html">Data</a> topic.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Data thumbnailing (how animation works)</b></font>
<p>
To save memory, VisBio only keeps one dimensional position of the dataset
(e.g., one timestep) in memory at a time, thus allowing visualization of huge
datasets quickly. Unfortunately, when switching positions, VisBio needs to load
the new position into memory from disk, which takes time and slows down
animation.
<p>
To sidestep this problem, VisBio reads in all data when it first imports the
dataset. It creates a low-resolution thumbnail of every image, keeping all
these thumbnails in memory at once. It does this in the background, so that you
can begin visualizing your data even before all thumbnails have been computed.
You can see how far along the computation is from the progress bar below the
data information box. You can stop the computation process by clicking the
"Stop" button next the progress bar, if you wish to conserve memory or CPU use.
<p>
VisBio has a "lo-res" mode and a "hi-res" mode. In lo-res mode the thumbnail
is displayed, whereas in hi-res mode the data is loaded from disk. When you
switch positions, VisBio uses lo-res mode by default to avoid the slowdown of
going to disk for the data. Thus, animation is still quick.
<p>
VisBio loads hi-res data for the current dimensional position in the
background. If it finishes loading the hi-res data, it displays it. Thus, the
hi-res data will eventually "burn in" if you leave the displays idle for a
moment.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Controlling thumbnailing</b></font>
<p>
Since the thumbnails' memory footprint is much smaller than it would be at full
resolution, VisBio gives you both efficient memory use and realtime animation
at the expense of an initial thumbnail loading time.
<p>
The default thumbnail resolution is 96 x 96 pixels. Making these numbers
smaller will result in lo-res mode looking blockier but thumbnails taking less
memory, whereas larger numbers will require more memory to store the thumbnails
but look crisper while animating. <i>[Author's note: Sorry, options for
controlling thumbnailing parameters are not included in this beta release.]</i>
