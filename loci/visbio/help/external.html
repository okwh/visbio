<html><body><h2>External programs</h2>

<p>VisBio has the ability to interface with certain external programs. If you
have a routine written in C, C++ or some other language, you can set up an
external program data object that takes an existing data object as input and
generates output data by calling its associated external program for each image
plane.

<br><h3>Calling an external program from VisBio</h3>

First, import your dataset as described in the
<a href="import_data.html">Importing a dataset from disk</a> topic. Select your
data from the list, then click the "Add &gt;" button and choose "External
program" from the popup menu.

<p>Type in the path to your program (relative or absolute; if it works
from the command line, it should work within VisBio), then choose a name for
the new object. VisBio will create another data object, a child of your
original dataset, that represents the results of the program. VisBio will make
a system call to your program for each image plane of the parent data object.

<br><h3>Writing an external program for use in VisBio</h3>

VisBio does not care how an external program is constructed (e.g., the language
in which it is written, the libraries it uses, etc.), but it does expect the
program to conform to certain rules. Your program must provide support for the
three distinct scenarios in which it will be called:

<p>First, VisBio calls "<code>/path/to/program --params</code>" to retrieve a
list of parameters and their default values. It expects to see a series of
lines on stdout, with the first line corresponding to the first parameter's
name, the second to its default value, the third to the second parameter's
name, and so on. Note that for maximum flexibility, all parameters are strings,
but of course your program is free to parse the strings into some other format
(the scale.cpp example program treats its two parameters as integers).

<p>Secondly, VisBio calls "<code>/path/to/program --predict --width X --height
Y --planes N A B C ...</code>" where X, Y and N represent the dimensions of an
input image (X by Y resolution with N range components) and A, B, C, etc., are
parameter values for the function. VisBio expects to see three lines on stdout
corresponding to the X, Y and N dimensions of the output image that would be
produced were an actual image to be passed in with the specified parameters.
The purpose of requiring this functionality is to provide VisBio with a way to
predict how big the output images will be for a given set of input images with
certain parameter values. Note that VisBio requires that all output images be
dimensioned the same for each given set of image dimensions and parameters.

<p>Lastly, VisBio makes the actual call of "<code>/path/to/program --predict
--width X --height Y --planes N A B C ...</code>" (the same as the second call,
but without the "<code>--predict</code>" flag). With this syntax, your program
should begin accepting little-endian binary floating point data on stdin,
dimensioned according to the specified image dimensions, rasterized in NYX
order. After performing its intended function on the input data, it should
output the results to stdout in the same format.

<p>VisBio comes with an example program written in C++, scale.cpp, that
illustrates the above features.
