<br><h3>Data thumbnailing (how animation works)</h3>

To save memory, VisBio only keeps one dimensional position of the dataset
(e.g., one timestep) in memory at a time, thus allowing visualization of huge
datasets quickly. Unfortunately, when switching positions, VisBio needs to load
the new position into memory from disk, which takes time and slows down
animation.

<p>To sidestep this problem, VisBio reads in all data when it first imports the
dataset. It creates a low-resolution thumbnail of every image, keeping all
these thumbnails in memory at once. It does this in the background, so that you
can begin visualizing your data even before all thumbnails have been computed.
You can see how far along the computation is from the progress bar in the main
VisBio window. You can stop the computation process by clicking the "Stop"
button next the progress bar, if you wish to conserve memory or CPU use.

<p>VisBio has a "lo-res" mode and a "hi-res" mode. In lo-res mode the thumbnail
is displayed, whereas in hi-res mode the data is loaded from disk. When you
switch positions, VisBio uses lo-res mode by default to avoid the slowdown of
going to disk for the data, keeping animation quick.

<p>VisBio loads hi-res data for the current dimensional position in the
background. If it finishes loading the hi-res data, it displays it. Thus, the
hi-res data will eventually "burn in" if you leave the displays idle for a
moment.

<br><h3>Controlling thumbnailing</h3>

Since the thumbnails' memory footprint is much smaller than it would be at
full resolution, VisBio gives you both efficient memory use and realtime
animation at the expense of an initial thumbnail loading time.

<p>The default thumbnail resolution is 96 x 96 pixels. Making these numbers
smaller will result in lo-res mode looking blockier but thumbnails taking less
memory, whereas larger numbers will require more memory to store the thumbnails
but look crisper while animating.
<i>[Author's note: Sorry, options for controlling thumbnailing parameters are
not included in this beta release.]</i>

<br><h3>Thumbnail disk cache files</h3>

For each dataset you import, VisBio creates a disk cache of computed thumbnails
in a file with extension ".visbio" in the same directory as your dataset. If
this file already exists, VisBio reads the thumbnails from it, greatly speeding
thumbnail generation. To cause VisBio to regenerate thumbnails from the source
data, just delete the ".visbio" cache file.
