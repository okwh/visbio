<h2>The Capture Dialog Box</h2>
</center>
<p>
The Capture dialog box contains functions for recording of AVI movies of smooth
transitions between display positions. To access it, click the "Capture" button
on a display's control panel, or on the Displays panel (see the
<a href="displays.html">Displays</a> topic for more information).

<p>
To create a movie of a VisBio display in motion, navigate the display to
the desired orientation (see the <a href="displays.html">Displays</a> topic for
more information), then click the "Add" button. An entry will appear on the
list of display positions. Repeat this process for each display position in
the chain.
<p>
The "Remove" button will eliminate the currently selected entry in the list.
The "Up" and "Down" buttons will move the currently selected entry up or down
in the list, respectively.
<p>
You can click an entry on the list to restore the display to that position.
Thus, the list also serves a useful way to capture effective visualization
angles, in addition to movie creation.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Creating a movie of transitions</b></font>
<p>
By clicking the "Create movie" button, VisBio will construct an AVI movie
consisting of the display being rotated, translated and zoomed between the
positions defined in the list. In this way, a movie can be made of the display
shifting between any set of orientations.
<p>
By default, the transitions start slowly, speed up, then slow down again at
each display position, resulting in a smooth animation with emphasis on each of
the defined display positions. However, by unchecking the "Emphasize transition
at each display position" checkbox, this behavior can be changed so that each
transition is completely linear.
<p>
Lastly, the speed of the transitions can be controlled with the "Speed" slider.
