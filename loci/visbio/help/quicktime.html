<h2>Enabling QuickTime in VisBio</h2>
</center>
<p>
Support for reading and writing QuickTime movies and Openlab LIFF datasets
is built into VisBio, but it requires that you have QuickTime for Java
installed on your machine.
<p>
If you are running Mac OS X, you probably already have QuickTime installed.
If you are running Linux, QuickTime is unfortunately not available.
<p>
If you do not have QuickTime installed, please visit the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime download page</a>.
In the upper left corner of the page, choose your operating system.
<p>
On Windows systems, choose &quot;Win 98/Me/2000/XP&quot; (not &quot;QuickTime
+ iTunes Combo&quot;) so that the Custom QuickTime installation
option is available. When prompted, choose to do a Custom installation. Be sure
to install QuickTime Internet Extras and QuickTime for Java, since VisBio
requires them.
<p>
Once QuickTime for Java is installed on your machine, VisBio will be able to
import QuickTime movies and Openlab LIFF datasets. On Windows systems, VisBio
will also gain the capability to export datasets as QuickTime movies.
<i>[Author's note: Sorry, "Export to disk" feature is not available in this
beta release.]</i>
