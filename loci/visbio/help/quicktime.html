<h2>Enabling QuickTime in VisBio</h2>
</center>
<p>
Support for reading and writing QuickTime files is built into VisBio, but it
requires that you have QuickTime for Java installed on your machine.
<p>
If you do not have QuickTime installed, please visit the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime download page</a>.
In the upper left corner of the page, choose your operating system.
<p>
On Windows systems, choose &quot;Win 98/Me/2000/XP&quot; (not &quot;QuickTime
and iTunes for Windows 2000/XP&quot;) so that the Custom QuickTime installation
option is available. When prompted, choose to do a Custom installation. Be sure
to install QuickTime Internet Extras and QuickTime for Java, since VisBio
requires them.
<p>
Once QuickTime for Java is installed on your machine, VisBio will be able to
read and write QuickTime movies.
