<html><body><h2>Appearance settings</h2>

<p>Several controls are available for changing the display's appearance.

<p>Use the <img src="../view/zoom-in.png"> (zoom in),
<img src="../view/zoom-out.png"> (zoom out) and
<img src="../view/zoom-reset.png"> (reset zoom) buttons to alter
the zoom factor. You can also zoom using Shift + right mouse drag vertically
within the display, or with the up and down arrow keys while holding Shift.

<p>Use the <img src="../view/pan-left.png"> (pan left),
<img src="../view/pan-right.png"> (pan right),
<img src="../view/pan-up.png"> (pan up) and
<img src="../view/pan-down.png"> (pan down) buttons to alter the
data's placement within the display. You can also pan using Ctrl + right mouse
drag within the display, or with the arrows keys while holding Ctrl.

<p>For 3D displays only, use the
<img src="../view/rotate-left.png"> (rotate left),
<img src="../view/rotate-right.png"> (rotate right),
<img src="../view/rotate-up.png"> (rotate up) and
<img src="../view/rotate-down.png"> (rotate down) buttons to
alter the data's orientation within the display. You can also rotate by
dragging the right mouse button within the display, or with the arrow keys
while holding Ctrl + Shift (and you can rotate around the camera's Z axis with
the left and right arrow keys while holding Shift).

<p>To alter the aspect ratio of the display (i.e., how "square" or
"rectangular" it looks), type new values into the "Aspect ratio X" and "Aspect
ratio Y" text boxes. For 3D displays, you can change "Z" as well.

<p>To toggle whether the display shows a scale along the data axes, check or
uncheck the "Scale" box. Use the "Bounding box" checkbox to toggle the white
bounding box surrounding the data.

<p>Lastly, VisBio allows recording of movies and capturing of screenshots for
any display. To access controls for performing these tasks, click the "Capture"
button. A dialog box will appear for creating screenshots and movies. For
complete instructions on using this dialog box, see the
<a href="capture.html">Capture window</a> topic.
