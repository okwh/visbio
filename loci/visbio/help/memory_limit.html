<html><body><h2>Changing the memory limit</h2>

<p>You can change the maximum amount of memory allocated to VisBio. Click the
"Change" button next to the "Memory maximum" value, and type a new value (in
megabytes) into the dialog box that appears. This change requires the program
to be restarted before taking effect. The new value must be at least 16, and
should be 256 or greater to take advantage of many of VisBio's features. It is
recommended that you do not specify a value greater than the amount of physical
RAM your computer has. Also, 32-bit Java has a hard limit of 2048. On many
systems, specifying a value greater than 1800 or so may not work.

<p>If you change the maximum memory value and VisBio then fails to load, then
you have probably entered a value that is too large for your computer to
handle. Reinstalling VisBio will fix the problem. Alternately, if you know what
you are doing, you can change it back manually by editing the proper
configuration file (on Windows, change the "-mx###m" value in launcher.cfg; on
Mac OS X, change the "-Xmx###m" value in VisBio.app/Contents/Info.plist; on
Linux, change the "-mx###m" value in the visbio launch script).
