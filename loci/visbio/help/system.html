<h2>The System Panel</h2>
</center>
<p>
The System panel (also known as the "geek panel") contains helpful statistics
about your computer such as operating system version and Java Virtual Machine
version, as well as a report on VisBio's current memory use.
<p>
There is also a button labeled "Clean," which calls the Java garbage
collector when pressed, freeing up any wasted memory that has been temporarily
left lying around.
