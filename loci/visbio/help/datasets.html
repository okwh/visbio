<p>This topic explains how to import your multidimensional image data into
VisBio effectively.

<p>Throughout this explanation, we'll be using an example dataset called "dub,"
courtesy of Dr. Bill Mohler. The dataset consists of 85 Bio-Rad PIC files,
numbered dub01.pic through dub85.pic. The data is a time series of image
stacks, with each file representing one timestep, and each timestep containing
33 images (sampled at 33 distinct focal planes). Each image is 768 x 512
pixels, and the dataset is about 1 GB total on disk. Note that the
<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/sample_data.html">"sdub" dataset</a>
available for download from the
<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/">VisBio website</a> is a downsampled
version of the full "dub" dataset.

<p>From VisBio's perspective, this data is a collection of images with two
unique dimensional axes: Time and Slice. To most effectively work with this
data, it is important that you properly specify these dimensions during data
import.

<br><h3>Defining a dataset</h3>

To import your data into VisBio, choose the "Import data..." item from the
"File" menu (or click the "Add &gt;" button on the <a href="data.html">Data</a>
panel, then choose "Dataset" from the popup menu).

<p>A dialog box titled "Open file group" will appear. Click "Select file" and a
file chooser dialog box will appear. Now, navigate to the proper folder, select
one of the files in your dataset, and click "Open." VisBio will determine the
appropriate file pattern for your dataset. For example:

<p><img src="import-dialog1.png">

<p>In the above example, the pattern indicates that all files numbered
dub01.pic, dub02.pic, dub03.pic, etc., through dub85.pic, will be included in
the dataset.

<p>Click the "Next" button to continue. You will now see a dialog box that
looks like:

<p><img src="import-dialog2.png">

<p>The top line (in this case,
"C:\java\data\biorad\billm\dub&lt;01-85&gt;.pic") contains the file pattern
from the previous screen. Each dimensional range tag (e.g., "&lt;01-85&gt;")
represents one of the dataset's dimensional axes. In this case, VisBio guesses
that the file numbering marked "&lt;01-85&gt;" is a Time dimension. Of course,
you can use the dropdown list box to change the dimension to Slice or some
other dimension, if your data is organized that way. You can even type in a
custom name for the dimensional axis if you wish.

<p>Also, within each file, there are often several images. In the above case,
the data contains 33 images per file. VisBio has guessed that the image data
within each file is Slice data, but again, you can change that to Time or some
other dimension.

<p>After tweaking any necessary settings, click "Finish." The dataset has now
been imported, and the data information box will contain a bunch of
information. In our example, it will look like:

<p><table border="1"><tr><td>
C:\java\data\biorad\billm\dub<01-85>.pic
<p>Dimensionality: 4D
<ul>
  <li>85 time points</li>
  <li>33 focal planes</li>
  <li>768 x 512 pixels</li>
  <li>1 range component</li>
</ul>
85 Bio-Rad PIC files in dataset.
<br>2805 images totaling 1.03 gigapixels.
</td></tr></table>

<p>Now VisBio understands how your data is organized. To display the data
