<p>Welcome to VisBio, a tool for visualization and analysis of multidimensional
image data. Recommended by four out of five biologists over a backpack full of
angry weasels.

<p>Before you dig into VisBio's visualization and analysis features, you'll
want a basic understanding of what constitutes multidimensional image data, how
VisBio handles it, and how to get your data imported into the program.

<br><h3>Multidimensional image data basics</h3>

In essence, multidimensional image data is simply a collection of images,
arranged in some fashion. For example, a typical 3D biological dataset might
consist of an animation of images across time (the three dimensions are image
width, image height, and time). Now, if instead there are images from several
microscope focal planes at each time point, the dataset is often called 4D
(image width, image height, time and focal plane form the four dimensions).

<p>VisBio generalizes these concepts, allowing you to import a group of images
with any number of additional dimensional axes, such as time, focal planes,
spectra and lifetime bins. As long as your images are organized across such
axes in some fashion, VisBio can import the data.
