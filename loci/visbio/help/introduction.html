<html><body><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to VisBio, a tool for visualization and analysis of multidimensional
image data. Recommended by four out of five biologists over a backpack full of
angry weasels.

<p>Before you dig into VisBio's visualization and analysis features, you'll
want a basic understanding of what constitutes multidimensional image data, how
VisBio handles it, and how to get your data imported into the program.

<br><h3>Multidimensional image data basics</h3>

In essence, multidimensional image data is simply a collection of images,
arranged in some fashion. For example, a typical 3D biological dataset might
consist of an animation of images across time (the three dimensions are image
width, image height, and time). Now, if instead there are images from several
microscope focal planes at each time point, the dataset is often called 4D
(image width, image height, time and focal plane form the four dimensions).

<p>VisBio generalizes these concepts, allowing you to import a group of images
with any number of additional dimensional axes, such as time, focal planes,
spectra and lifetime bins. As long as your images are organized across such
axes in some fashion, VisBio can import the data.

<br><h3>Importing multidimensional image data</h3>

The next few sections will explain how to import your multidimensional image
data into VisBio effectively.

<p>Throughout this explanation, we'll be using an example dataset called "dub,"
courtesy of Dr. Bill Mohler. The dataset consists of 85 Bio-Rad PIC files,
numbered dub01.pic through dub85.pic. The data is a time series of image
stacks, with each file representing one timestep, and each timestep containing
33 images (sampled at 33 distinct focal planes). Each image is 768 x 512
pixels, and the dataset is about 1 GB total on disk. Note that the
<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/sample_data.html">"sdub" dataset</a>
available for download from the
<a href="http://www.loci.wisc.edu/visbio/">VisBio website</a> is a downsampled
version of the full "dub" dataset.

<p>From VisBio's perspective, this data is a collection of images with two
unique dimensional axes: Time and Slice. To most effectively work with this
data, it is important that you properly specify these dimensions during data
import.

<br><h3>Defining a dataset</h3>

To import your data into VisBio, choose the "Import data..." item from the
"File" menu (or click the "Add &gt;" button on the <a href="data.html">Data</a>
panel, then choose "Dataset" from the popup menu).

<p>A dialog box titled "Open file group" will appear. Click "Select file" and a
file chooser dialog box will appear. Now, navigate to the proper folder, select
one of the files in your dataset, and click "Open." VisBio will determine the
appropriate file pattern for your dataset. For example:
<br><center><img src="import-dialog1.png"></center>

<p>In the above example, the pattern indicates that all files numbered
dub01.pic, dub02.pic, dub03.pic, etc., through dub85.pic, will be included in
the dataset.

<p>Click the "Next" button to continue. You will now see a dialog box that
looks like:
<br><center><img src="import-dialog2.png"></center>

<p>The top line (in this case,
"C:\java\data\biorad\billm\dub&lt;01-85&gt;.pic") contains the file pattern
from the previous screen. Each dimensional range tag (e.g., "&lt;01-85&gt;")
represents one of the dataset's dimensional axes. In this case, VisBio guesses
that the file numbering marked "&lt;01-85&gt;" is a Time dimension. Of course,
you can use the dropdown list box to change the dimension to Slice or some
other dimension, if your data is organized that way. You can even type in a
custom name for the dimensional axis if you wish.

<p>Also, within each file, there are often several images. In the above case,
the data contains 33 images per file. VisBio has guessed that the image data
within each file is Slice data, but again, you can change that to Time or some
other dimension.

<p>After tweaking any necessary settings, click "Finish." The dataset has now
been imported, and the data information box will contain a bunch of
information. In our example, it will look like:
<br><center><table border="1"><tr><td>
C:\java\data\biorad\billm\dub<01-85>.pic
<p>Dimensionality: 4D
<ul>
  <li>85 time points</li>
  <li>33 focal planes</li>
  <li>768 x 512 pixels</li>
  <li>1 range component</li>
</ul>
85 Bio-Rad PIC files in dataset.
<br>2805 images totaling 1.03 gigapixels.
</td></tr></table></center>

<p>Now VisBio understands how your data is organized. For more information
