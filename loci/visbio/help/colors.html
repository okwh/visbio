<html><body><h2>Colors dialog box</h2>

<p>The Colors dialog box contains functions for adjusting the data's color
properties. To access it, select a data object from the list within the
<a href="data_settings.html">Data</a> controls of a
<a href="display_windows.html">display window</a>, then click the "Colors"
button. A dialog box like the following will appear:

<p>The dialog's preview display provides a quick view of the consequences of
any color changes made. Clicking the OK button will apply those changes to the
entire dataset.

<br><h3>Brightness and contrast</h3>

Image brightness and contrast can be adjusted with the brightness and contrast
sliders, respectively.

<br><h3>Opacity (transparency)</h3>

The opacity slider controls how opaque the data is. The rightmost value of 256
is 100% opaque, whereas the leftmost value of 0 is 100% transparent.

<p>The "Constant" transparency model behaves like a layer in Photoshop, with
the opacity value uniformly defining how opaque each pixel is.

<p>The "Curved" transparency model maps a transparency curve from the minimum
color value to the maximum color value, with the opacity value defining how
sharply the curve arcs. An opacity of 128 (the center of the slider) is a
straight line from min to max, meaning that pixels with the minimum color value
are completely transparent while pixels with the maximum color value are
completely opaque, with intermediate values weighted linearly. An opacity of 0
slants the line so that most pixels are nearly completely transparent unless
they are at or near the maximum value, while an opacity of 256 slants the line
so that most pixels are nearly opaque unless they are at or near the minimum
value. (If it sounds complex, don't worry: just play with it a bit while
watching the color table on the right and it will make perfect sense.)

<p>The "Curved" model is especially useful when performing volume rendering
(see the <a href="data_settings.html">Data settings</a> topic for more
information on volume rendering).

<br><h3>Range components</h3>

Data in VisBio has one or more range components. That is, at each pixel, there
may be one or more associated values. Often, there will be only one range
component (such as <i>intensity</i>, representing the intensity at that pixel),
although some data may have three range components (such as <i>red</i>,
<i>green</i> and <i>blue</i>, representing the red, green and blue values for
that pixel, respectively). Data collected with multi-spectral imaging
techniques may even have 32 or more range components.

<br><h3>Color models</h3>

VisBio supports three color models: RGB, HSV and Composite. In the RGB color
model, the color space is divided into the components <i>Red</i>, <i>Green</i>
and <i>Blue</i>, representing the levels of red, green and blue present at each
pixel, respectively. In the HSV color model, the color space is divided into
the components <i>Hue</i>, <i>Saturation</i> and <i>Value</i>, where hue
represents a value along a color continuum (similar to a rainbow), saturation
represents how saturated each pixel is with that color (the less saturated,
the whiter the pixel will be), and value represents the brightness of each
pixel (the less the value, the blacker the pixel will be). The Composite color
model maps all color components to a color continuum known as "pseudocolor" and
averages them, so that each pixel represents a composite of all its range
components.

<br><h3>Range component color mappings</h3>

Range components from the data can be mapped to one or more color components.
For example, data with one range component, <i>intensity</i>, could have
<i>intensity</i> mapped to <i>Red</i>, <i>Green</i> and <i>Blue</i>, producing
a standard grayscale image. For data with three range components, the natural
mapping is to map the first component to <i>Red</i>, the second to <i>Green</i>
and the third to <i>Blue</i>, fully representing the data in the RGB color
space.

<p>VisBio will attempt to guess at good range component mappings when data
is first loaded, but in some cases, adjustments may be necessary to achieve the
desired visualization. In particular, when the data has more than three range
components, you will probably want to choose which range components to map to
which color components for greatest effectiveness.

<p>To map a range component to a color component, choose the desired range
component from the color component's drop-down menu. For example, to map
<i>intensity</i> to <i>Red</i>, choose <i>intensity</i> from the drop-down
menu labeled <i>Red</i>.

<p>At times, it may be useful to fully saturate a color component, or
completely empty a color component. To zero out a color component, choose
<i>None</i> from that component's drop-down menu. To max out a color component,
choose <i>Full</i> instead.

<p>Lastly, when the Composite color model is selected, the range component
drop-down menus will be grayed out, since all components are mapped to
pseudocolor.

<br><h3>Range component color tables</h3>

Each range component has an associated color table that fully represents its
mapping into the color space. To view this color table, choose the desired
range component from the drop-down menu above the color table. The displayed
color table and color range will change to represent the chosen range
component.

<p>By changing brightness, contrast, range component mappings and other
options, you will see the changes reflected in that range component's color
table. However, complete control over each color table is available if needed.
To modify a color table directly, drag the left mouse button across to the
table to modify the active color component level at different range values.
Click the right mouse button to cycle through active color components, from
<i>Red</i> to <i>Green</i> to <i>Blue</i> to <i>Alpha</i> (opacity) and back to
<i>Red</i>.

<p>The "Save LUT..." button allows you to preserve the current color table for
later use, by storing it on disk as a LUT file (compatible with ImageJ). The
"Load LUT..." button reads these LUT files back in and sets the color table
accordingly. VisBio also has several preset color tables available from the
popup menu accessible with the "LUTs &gt;" button.

<br><h3>Color scaling</h3>

Each range component has a range of values. By default, VisBio assumes the
minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 255. That is, a range component
value of 0 corresponds to the leftmost color in its color table, whereas a
range component value of 255 corresponds to the rightmost color in the table.

<p>Of course, it may not be the case that a particular range component conforms
to this assumption. Thus, minimum and maximum range values can be manually
specified for each range component by typing them into the appropriate text
boxes after checking the "Fixed color range" option. Alternately, VisBio will
compute these bounds automatically if "Fixed color range" is unchecked.
