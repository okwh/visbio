<html><body><h2>System panel</h2>

<p>The System panel (also known as the "geek panel") contains helpful
statistics about your computer such as operating system version, Java Virtual
Machine version, and optional installed libraries, as well as a report on
VisBio's current memory use.

<p>The "Dump all" button prints all Java system properties to the
Output Console.

<p>The "Clean" button instructs the Java garbage collector to free up any
wasted memory that has been temporarily left lying around.

<p>You can also change the amount of memory available to VisBio (see the
<a href="memory_limit.html">Changing the memory limit</a> topic), as well as
the program's graphical "Look &amp; Feel" (see the
<a href="look_and_feel.html">Changing VisBio's appearance</a> topic).
