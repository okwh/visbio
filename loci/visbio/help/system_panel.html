<html><body><h2>System panel</h2>

<p>The System panel (also known as the "geek panel") contains helpful
statistics about your computer such as operating system version, Java Virtual
Machine version, and optional installed libraries, as well as a report on
VisBio's current memory use.

<p>The button labeled "Clean" instructs the Java garbage collector to free up
any wasted memory that has been temporarily left lying around.

<p>You can also change the maximum amount of memory allocated to VisBio, as
well as VisBio's graphical "Look &amp; Feel." These changes require the program
to be restarted before taking effect.
