<html><body><h2>Other formats (JPEG, BMP, etc.)</h2>

<p>VisBio supports reading a variety of other single-image formats (not
including metadata), including BMP, DICOM, FITS, GIF, JPEG, PGM and PICT.

<p>Support for BMP, DICOM, FITS, GIF, JPEG and PGM is provided by ImageJ (which
comes packaged with VisBio).

<p>PICT support requires that QuickTime for Java be installed. If you are
running Mac OS X, you probably already have QuickTime installed. If you are
running Linux, QuickTime is unfortunately not available.  If you do not have
QuickTime installed, visit the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone/">QuickTime download page</a>.
Once QuickTime for Java is installed on your machine, VisBio will be able to
import Openlab LIFF files.
