<html><body><h2>Other formats (JPEG, BMP, etc.)</h2>

<p>VisBio supports reading a variety of other single-image formats (not
including metadata), including BMP, DICOM, FITS, GIF, JPEG, PGM, PICT and PNG.

<p>Support for BMP, DICOM, FITS, GIF, JPEG, PGM and PNG is provided by ImageJ
(which comes packaged with VisBio).

<p>PICT support requires that QuickTime for Java be installed. If you are
running Mac OS X, you probably already have QuickTime installed. If you are
running Linux, QuickTime is unfortunately not available. If you do not have
QuickTime installed, visit the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/standalone/">QuickTime
download page</a>. Once QuickTime for Java is installed on your machine,
VisBio will be able to import PICT images.
