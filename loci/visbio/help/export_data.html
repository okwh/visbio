<html><body><h2>Exporting data to disk</h2>

<p>VisBio contains powerful features for exporting data to different formats.
To export the current raw dataset, click the "Export data" button on the Data
tab (or choose "Export data..." from the File menu). A dialog box will appear:

<p><img src="export-dialog1.png" alt="Export dialog, page 1">

<p>Enter the file pattern that defines how your files will be named. Place
asterisks (*) where the file numbering should occur. In the example above, the
pattern indicates that the data will be numbered C:\data\out1.tiff through
C:\data\outX.tiff, where X is the maximum value of the numbering's associated
dimensional axis (e.g., time points).

<p>Also, choose the appropriate output format from the dropdown list box on the
right.

<p>Click the "Next" button to proceed. You will see a dialog like the
following:

<p><img src="export-dialog2.png" alt="Export dialog, page 2">

<p>The first line (in our example, "C:\data\out&lt;A&gt;.tiff") indicates the
file pattern, with asterisks replaced by letter tags. For each letter tag,
you'll notice a dropdown list box allowing you to map that letter to one of the
data's dimensional axes. In our example, &lt;A&gt; gets mapped to TIME, meaning
that each file will contain one timestep of the data.

<p>The "Pad file numbering with leading zeroes" checkbox is useful if you want
the files to be numbered with fixed width integers. For example, if our example
data contains 85 timesteps, checking the box results in filenames out01.tiff
through out85.tiff, instead of the default out1.tiff through out85.tiff.

<p>The image resolution text fields allow you to specify each image's width and
height (the default values correspond to the input data's actual resolution).

<p>Then, for each dimensional axis, you can subsample the data, just as you can
when creating a screen dataset. In our example, you could choose to export only
timepoints 5 through 20, subsampling to every third timestep (5, 8, 11, 14, 17,
20), as well as every second slice from 20 to 28 (20, 22, 24, 26, 28).
Note, however, that the output filenames in this case will still be out1.tiff
through out6.tiff, because there are six total timesteps being exported.

<p>Lastly, you can choose to include only a subset of the data's range values.
As with screen data, you must include at least one range value, otherwise there
would be no data left to export!

<p>When you have all parameters configured properly, click the "Next" button
again to continue. You'll see a summary screen like this one:
