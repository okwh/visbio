<h2>VisBio's Displays</h2>
</center>
<p>
<font size="+2"><b>The Displays panel</b></font>
<p>
The Displays panel contains functions managing VisBio's displays.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Creating a display</b></font>
<p>
To create a new 2D display, click the "Add 2D" button. When prompted, enter a
name for the new display (or just click OK to use the default name). To create
a new 3D display, click the "Add 3D" button instead. Once created, the display
will appear in the list to the left.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Removing a display</b></font>
<p>
To delete a display, select it from the list and click the "Remove" button.
All parameters for that display (e.g., color settings) will be lost.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Showing a display onscreen</b></font>
<p>
Once you add data to a display (using the <a href="data.html">Data</a> panel),
the display will automatically appear onscreen. However, if the display window
or its controls later become hidden, you can bring them back by selecting that
display from the list, then clicking the "Show" button.
<p>
<font size="+2"><b>Display controls</b></font>
<p>
Once a display is visible onscreen, you will see a large panel of controls for
manipulating it. Notice the four arrows around the edges of the control panel.
Clicking these arrows allows you to change their placement. That is, you can
lodge the controls to the left, right, top or bottom of the display itself, or
break them off completely into a separate window (just click the arrow
corresponding to where the controls are already placed).
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Appearance</b></font>
<p>
Several controls are available for changing the display's general appearance.
<p>
Use the <img align="center" src="../view/zoom-in.png"> (zoom in),
<img align="center" src="../view/zoom-out.png"> (zoom out) and
<img align="center" src="../view/zoom-reset.png"> (reset zoom) buttons to alter
the zoom factor. You can also zoom using SHIFT + right mouse drag vertically
within the display.
<p>
Use the <img align="center" src="../view/pan-left.png"> (pan left),
<img align="center" src="../view/pan-right.png"> (pan right),
<img align="center" src="../view/pan-up.png"> (pan up) and
<img align="center" src="../view/pan-down.png"> (pan down) buttons to alter the
data's placement within the display. You can also pan using CTRL + right mouse
drag within the display.
<p>
For 3D displays only, use the
<img align="center" src="../view/rotate-left.png"> (rotate left),
<img align="center" src="../view/rotate-right.png"> (rotate right),
<img align="center" src="../view/rotate-up.png"> (rotate up) and
<img align="center" src="../view/rotate-down.png"> (rotate down) buttons to
alter the data's orientation within the display. You can also rotate by
dragging the right mouse button within the display.
<p>
To alter the aspect ratio of the display (i.e., how "square" or "rectangular"
it looks), type new values into the "Aspect ratio X" and "Aspect ratio Y" text
boxes. For 3D displays, you can change "Z" as well.
<p>
To toggle whether the display shows a scale along the data axes, check or
uncheck the "Scale" box. Use the "Bounding box" checkbox to toggle the white
bounding box surrounding the data.
<p>
VisBio has flexible color mapping support, for controlling how VisBio colors
your data. To adjust the colors, click the "Colors" button. A dialog box will
appear for adjusting the color settings. For complete instructions on using
this dialog box, see the <a href="colors.html">Colors</a> topic.
<p>
Lastly, VisBio allows recording of movies and capturing of screenshots for any
display. To access controls for performing these tasks, click the "Capture"
button. A dialog box will appear for creating screenshots and movies. For
complete instructions on using this dialog box, see the
<a href="capture.html">Capture</a> topic.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Data</b></font>
<p>
The "Linked data" drop-down box lists all data objects that are part of this
display. To toggle the visibility of a data object, check or uncheck the
"Visible" checkbox.
<p>
To add another data object to the display, click the "Add &lt;" button, then
choose a data object from the popup menu. To remove a data object, select it
from the drop-down box, then click the "Remove" button. Lastly, the "Controls"
button brings up a set of controls for the selected data object, if it has one.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Position</b></font>
<p>
The "Animate" button cycles through the selected animation axis (specified in
the drop-down box to the right of the button), using low-resolution thumbnails.
The "FPS" selector allows specification of animation speed in frames per
second.
<p>
Below the animation controls are a series of sliders corresponding to your
data's dimensional axes. These sliders control the currently displayed image
(or image stack). Use them judiciously to browse your data's depths!
