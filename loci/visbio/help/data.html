<h2>The Data Panel</h2>
</center>
<p>
The Data panel allows you to import data into VisBio, so that you can begin
visualization and analysis. Importing your data is usually the first step when
using VisBio.
<p>
For an introduction to data import, please read the
<a href="overview.html">Overview</a> topic first. If you are looking for more
detailed information about data subsampling, export, OME upload or other l33+
feecherz, you'll find them below.
<p>

<p>
Sometimes, it is desirable to create a version of your data at a lower
resolution, with fewer dimensional positions or fewer range components, to
conserve memory or improve rendering time. VisBio refers to this procedure as
"subsampling." To do it, first import your dataset as described in the
<a href="overview.html">Overview</a> topic. Select your data from the list,
then click the "Add &gt;" button and choose "Subsampling" from the popup menu.
<p>
Choose a name for the subsampling, and VisBio will create another data object,
a child of your original dataset, that represents the subsampling. To alter the
sampling parameters, select the subsampled data object and click the "Edit"
button. A window similar to the following one will appear:

<p>
You can subsample the image resolution, as well as each dimensional axis. In
the example above, Time is subsampled to every fourth timestep
(1, 5, 9, ..., 81, 85), and Slice is subsampled to every second timestep
(1, 3, 5, ..., 31, 33).
<p>
Lastly, you can choose to exclude one or more range components of the data, by
unchecking those range component checkboxes. In the example above, there is
only one range component, and you must have at least one range component
included in the dataset (otherwise there would be no data!). However, if the
data instead had three components<i>—</i>Red, Green and Blue<i>—</i>you could
choose to include only the Green component, for example.
<p>
When finished, click the "Apply" button to lock in your changes. VisBio will
recompute thumbnails as necessary for the new sampling parameters.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Visualizing data</b></font>
<p>
To visualize a data object, select it from the list, then click the
"Display &gt;" button. To view the data in an existing display, choose it from
the popup menu. To view it in a new display, choose "New 2D display..." or
"New 3D display..." and type in a name for the new display. In either case, the
data will be added to the specified display and immediately shown onscreen. See
the <a href="displays.html">Displays</a> topic for more information on
controlling visualization parameters within a display.
<p>

<p>
Lastly, you may have noticed three other buttons relating to data objects. The
"Export" button lets you export the data object to a group of files on disk
<i>[Author's note: Sorry, export features are not available in this alpha
release.]</i>, the "Upload" button allows you to upload the data object to an
OME database (see the <a href="ome.html">OME</a> topic for more information),
and the "Remove" button deletes the selected data object. Note that if the data
object to be removed has children, they will be deleted as well.
